# About These Lists

These lists intend to provide a place for fans of the British Touring Car Championship to catch up and re-watch races from the past, and as a reference point for the future. These lists do not intend to infinge copyright, and the contributors to these lists do not accept liability for infringement by the uploaders of linked videos. These lists are free for anyone to contribute to and to update for the benefit of those in the future. We anticipate that some linked items may become unavailable so if this happens we ask that users help to keep the lists maintained by filing an issue report at [the issue tracker](https://github.com/fourohfour/btcc-youtube/issues).

## List Syntax

Links follow format as follows:

>[Uploader Name] [HD/SD] [Site] - Link

Note that due to Google+ integration, a user's real name may show instead of their username on YouTube. Despite this, editors should strive to use the uploader's username in this list.


## Uploaders

Uploaders are listed in Uploaders.md and should be referred to in lists by the name given in Uploaders.md - where they are listed with their username and a link to their user page on their respective website.
